# Functional Programming

Questions that were solved and given as home work during Week 5 of neog.camp

## Pure functions

For the same input the output is always the same

- Atleast one argument
- Return a value
- should not mutate any of the arguments

# Higher Order function

A function that can either take function as an argument and or return a function or both is a higherorder function
